### Summary ###

AsciiPanelWindowingToolkit, or APWT, is a set of classes and utilities that will make working with AsciiPanel on a larger scale much easier. It includes support for screens, text windows, multicolored strings, and defines constants for different CP437 characters. APWT, of course, depends on [AsciiPanel](github.com/trystan/AsciiPanel), as well as [SquidLib](https://github.com/SquidPony/SquidLib) and my utility library, [MaugriftUtils](https://bitbucket.org/Maugrift/maugriftutils). Jar files for all of these libraries are included in the ``lib`` directory, which you can include as dependencies in your projects.

### License ###

APWT is licensed under the MIT license. Basically, this lets you copy, modify, distribute, and sell the library or works that use it, privately or publicly. See the LICENSE.txt file for the complete license, and know that this description is not a substitute for it.

### Implementation ###

To set up APWT, download the sources or the library jars and include them as dependencies in your project. To start using APWT, initialize a Display object and go from there. The Display is designed to work with a hierarchy of Screens, each of which read input and display output. For more on this, see [Trystan's Roguelike tutorial](https://trystans.blogspot.com/2016/01/roguelike-tutorial-00-table-of-contents.html).

### Contribution ###

If you want to contribute to the project, I would happy to accept reasonable pull requests. Please create JavaDoc comments on any added methods, classes, and constants. If you have IntelliJ IDEA, please download the ``APWT.xml`` code style from Downloads and apply it to files you change (default is Ctrl+Alt+L). The project also has a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/oY7z1nm5) that outlines planned features.
